* Position this as a part research and part survey paper.

* Two clients sending login requests for "unknown principal"
  are able to cause 100% CPU utilization on the KDC.

  Incoming traffic is < 45 KiB and and outgoing traffic is
  < 40 KiB.

  Client's CPU utilization is <= 15 percent. This can be reduced
  further a lot.

  AS-REQ UDP packet size is 241 bytes
